DISCO
* Can style multiple tags by separating with commas
* Link a css file to an html file by adding  <link rel=“stylesheet” type=“text/css” href=“STYLE FILE”> inside <head></head>
* Can inline style directly in html file with style attribute in tag
* Wrapping parts of html with a div allows us to style in chunks
* Indents do not matter in html
* "margin:auto;" centers the entire body


QCC
* Were we suppose to use tables to replicate the screenshot?
* Why doesn't "margin:"" 0px; apply to h1 and h2 when you put it in .body of the css?
* We were unable to wrap table cell with div and change its width.
