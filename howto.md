# HowTo Markdown like a pro

> What is markdown?

Markdown is a basic syntax used for formatting simple text. It allows for a multitude of text manipulation, such as size and formatting. Many common word processors such as Microsoft word and Google docs implement these features, but the syntax is hidden from you. Markdown allows you to specify, inline, what moddifications you want to apply to your text.

> What types of formatting does markdown support?

Markdown suports six diffrent font sizes, denoted by the amount of '\#' placed at the start of the line. One '\#' is the largest, while six '\#'s is the smallest.

Basic Markdown supports three other text modifications. *Italic* text can be denoted using one '\*' on either side of a word. **Bold** text can be denoted using two '*'s on either side of a word. 
~~Strikethrough~~ can be denoted with two '\~~' on either side of a word.

Extended Markdown supports three other modifications. ==Highlight== can be denoted with two '\==' on either side of a word. 
Subscript can be denoted with one '~' seperating the normal script and the subscript.
Superscript can be denoted with one '^' seperating the normal script and the superscript. 

Markdown also supports a number of text formatting that improves readablity, but does not change the text it self. 

Ordered lists can be denoted using numbers starting at 1, and unordered lists can be denoted using a '*'.
