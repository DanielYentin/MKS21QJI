Javascript, similar to python, has a concept of truthiness. You can test for truthiness using the "==" operator. 

For example any empty string is considered to be falsey, whereas and non empty string is considerd truthy. So doing a comparison such as "" == false would return true, and doing a comparison such as "hello world" == true would also return true.

If you want to compare strict equality, where the types must also match, then you can use the "===" operator.
