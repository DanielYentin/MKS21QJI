K19 -- Sessions
2022-11-07
time spent: 1hr

DISCO:
* ```from flask import session ``` imports cookies into python
* ```session[KEY] = value``` creates new key in session
* ```session.pop(KEY)``` removes a key and its value from the session
* action attribute in html tells backend which function to refer to when it is activated

QCC:
* We couldn't seem to make the button go to the logout function using action attribute in the marker so we wrapped it in a form and added the attribute there
* How do you make buttons direct to a route in html?
* How is the cookies transferred from the local machine to other machines?
